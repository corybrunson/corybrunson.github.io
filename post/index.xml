      <title>my reaction to Hidden Figures</title>

      <description>I’m a bit overwhelmed and a bit sick this month, and i didn’t want to miss two fortnights in a row. I wrote up this reaction to seeing the film Hidden Figures a couple of years ago on Facebook, and several of my friends liked it then, so i’m sharing it here. It’s slightly edited. –Cory
Hidden Figures was probably the best civil rights–focused film i’ve seen in a while—not to disparage Selma or The Butler, but my personal taste is for greater subtlety.</description>

      <title>defining and taxonomizing alluvial diagrams</title>

      <description>Background I first encountered alluvial diagrams, so-called, in a widely-shared paper by Martin Rosvall and Carl T. Bergstrom. They were investigating the shifting boundaries between distinct scientific fields (“modules”), as reconstructed from sequential years of journal citation data (“states”), and proposed a specialized flow diagram “to highlight the significant changes, fusions, and fissions that the modules undergo between each pair of successive states”. At the time, i was unfamiliar with Sankey diagrams and only passingly familiar with flow diagrams—mostly by way of my computational biologist colleagues and their literature-derived signal transduction networks—but i could imagine myriad uses for this type of visualization and eventually went searching for an implementation in R.</description>

      <description>A project i’ve had in the works for years, and “almost done” since last summer, is a sensitivity and robustness analysis of several techniques used in studies of “comorbidity networks” (also “disease graphs”, “disease maps”, etc.) that have appeared over the past 20 years. As i begin the abstract:
 Comorbidity network analysis (CNA) is an increasingly popular approach in systems medicine, in which mathematical graphs encode epidemiological correlations (links) between diseases (nodes) inferred from their occurrence in an underlying patient population.</description>

      <description>A fundamental idea in biplot methodology is the conference of inertia, a phrase i picked up from an SO answer by ttnphns and quickly incorporated into ordr. The basic idea arises from the central properties of a biplot, illustrated here for principal components analysis: A case–variable data matrix \(X\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\) of ratio variables1 is singular-value decomposed as \(X=UDV^\top\), for example the mtcars data set:
x &amp;lt;- scale(mtcars, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE) s &amp;lt;- svd(x) r &amp;lt;- length(s$d) Under this convention, \(U\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times r}\) and \(V\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times r}\) arise from eigendecompositions of \(XX^\top\) and of \(X^\top X\), respectively, and \(D\in\mathbb{R}^{r\times r}\) is the diagonal matrix of the square roots of their (common) eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>For over a year (intermittently, not cumulatively) i’ve been developing an R package, ordr, for incorporating ordination techniques into a tidyverse workflow. (Credit where it’s due: Emily Paul, a summer intern from Avon High School, helped extend the package functionality and has since used it in other projects and provided critical feedback on its design.) This week, i finally deployed a pkgdown website and tweeted a meek solicitation for feedback.</description>

      <description>inreach I make a habit of responding when people reach out for mathematical support in their work, at least when i think i can contribute something. An interesting network effect of this habit is that i actually get more second-hand (i.e. forwarded) feelers from colleagues than first-hand requests. As a result, i’ve gotten exposure to a lot of disciplines and questions that i’d’ve otherwise been unaware of entirely, for example the problem of feature identification in the immune profiles of cancer patients and the statistical bookkeeping required to model the nested factors determining medical imaging phenotypes.</description>
