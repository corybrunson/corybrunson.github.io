      <description>how to use computed variables One of the many subtle features of ggplot2 is the ability to pass variables to aesthetics that are not present in the data but rather are computed internally by a statistical transformation (stat). For users, the documentation for this feature illustrates the use of stat(&amp;lt;variable&amp;gt;) (previously ..&amp;lt;variable&amp;gt;.., since upgraded to after_stat(&amp;lt;variable&amp;gt;)) in an aesthetic specification.
Some stats do this by default. For example, the count stat sends its computed count to both coordinate aesthetics by default.</description>

      <title>the dimensions of (abstracted) polyamory literature</title>

      <description>I’ve gained immensely from reading the handful of non-fiction books on polyamory i’ve made time to, including Dossie Easton and Janet Hardy’s The Ethical Slut and Franklin Veaux and Eve Rickert’s More Than Two. While i’ve identified as poly since i discovered the term in grad school, i exhibit at least my share of emotional immaturity, and in addition to actual experience building healthy relationships i know i’d benefit from funneling a bit more of this literature into my reading queue.</description>

      <title>my reaction to Hidden Figures</title>

      <description>I’m a bit overwhelmed and a bit sick this month, and i didn’t want to miss two fortnights in a row. I wrote up this reaction to seeing the film Hidden Figures a couple of years ago on Facebook, and several of my friends liked it then, so i’m sharing it here. It’s slightly edited. –Cory
Hidden Figures was probably the best civil rights–focused film i’ve seen in a while—not to disparage Selma or The Butler, but my personal taste is for greater subtlety.</description>

      <title>defining and taxonomizing alluvial diagrams</title>
      <link>/2019/09/13/flow-taxonomy/</link>

      <description>Background I first encountered alluvial diagrams, so-called, in a widely-shared paper by Martin Rosvall and Carl T. Bergstrom. They were investigating the shifting boundaries between distinct scientific fields (“modules”), as reconstructed from sequential years of journal citation data (“states”), and proposed a specialized flow diagram “to highlight the significant changes, fusions, and fissions that the modules undergo between each pair of successive states”. At the time, i was unfamiliar with Sankey diagrams and only passingly familiar with flow diagrams—mostly by way of my computational biologist colleagues and their literature-derived signal transduction networks—but i could imagine myriad uses for this type of visualization and eventually went searching for an implementation in R.</description>

      <description>A project i’ve had in the works for years, and “almost done” since last summer, is a sensitivity and robustness analysis of several techniques used in studies of “comorbidity networks” (also “disease graphs”, “disease maps”, etc.) that have appeared over the past 20 years. As i begin the abstract:
 Comorbidity network analysis (CNA) is an increasingly popular approach in systems medicine, in which mathematical graphs encode epidemiological correlations (links) between diseases (nodes) inferred from their occurrence in an underlying patient population.</description>

      <description>A fundamental idea in biplot methodology is the conference of inertia, a phrase i picked up from an SO answer by ttnphns and quickly incorporated into ordr. The basic idea arises from the central properties of a biplot, illustrated here for principal components analysis: A case–variable data matrix \(X\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\) of ratio variables1 is singular-value decomposed as \(X=UDV^\top\), for example the mtcars data set:
x &amp;lt;- scale(mtcars, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE) s &amp;lt;- svd(x) r &amp;lt;- length(s$d) Under this convention, \(U\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times r}\) and \(V\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times r}\) arise from eigendecompositions of \(XX^\top\) and of \(X^\top X\), respectively, and \(D\in\mathbb{R}^{r\times r}\) is the diagonal matrix of the square roots of their (common) eigenvalues.</description>
