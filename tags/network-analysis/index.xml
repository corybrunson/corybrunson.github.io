      <description>A project i’ve had in the works for years, and “almost done” since last summer, is a sensitivity and robustness analysis of several techniques used in studies of “comorbidity networks” (also “disease graphs”, “disease maps”, etc.) that have appeared over the past 20 years. As i begin the abstract:
