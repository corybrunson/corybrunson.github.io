      <description>I’m a bit overwhelmed and a bit sick this month, and i didn’t want to miss two fortnights in a row. I wrote up this reaction to seeing the film Hidden Figures a couple of years ago on Facebook, and several of my friends liked it then, so i’m sharing it here. It’s slightly edited. –Cory
Hidden Figures was probably the best civil rights–focused film i’ve seen in a while—not to disparage Selma or The Butler, but my personal taste is for greater subtlety.</description>
