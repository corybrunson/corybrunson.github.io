      <description>I’ve gained immensely from reading the handful of non-fiction books on polyamory i’ve made time to, including Dossie Easton and Janet Hardy’s The Ethical Slut and Franklin Veaux and Eve Rickert’s More Than Two. While i’ve identified as poly since i discovered the term in grad school, i exhibit at least my share of emotional immaturity, and in addition to actual experience building healthy relationships i know i’d benefit from funneling a bit more of this literature into my reading queue.</description>
