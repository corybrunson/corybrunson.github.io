      <description>I’ve gained immensely from reading the handful of non-fiction books on polyamory i’ve made time to, including Dossie Easton and Janet Hardy’s The Ethical Slut and Franklin Veaux and Eve Rickert’s More Than Two. While i’ve identified as poly since i discovered the term in grad school, i exhibit at least my share of emotional immaturity, and in addition to actual experience building healthy relationships i know i’d benefit from funneling a bit more of this literature into my reading queue.</description>

      <description>A fundamental idea in biplot methodology is the conference of inertia, a phrase i picked up from an SO answer by ttnphns and quickly incorporated into ordr. The basic idea arises from the central properties of a biplot, illustrated here for principal components analysis: A case–variable data matrix \(X\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\) of ratio variables1 is singular-value decomposed as \(X=UDV^\top\), for example the mtcars data set:
x &amp;lt;- scale(mtcars, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE) s &amp;lt;- svd(x) r &amp;lt;- length(s$d) Under this convention, \(U\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times r}\) and \(V\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times r}\) arise from eigendecompositions of \(XX^\top\) and of \(X^\top X\), respectively, and \(D\in\mathbb{R}^{r\times r}\) is the diagonal matrix of the square roots of their (common) eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>For over a year (intermittently, not cumulatively) i’ve been developing an R package, ordr, for incorporating ordination techniques into a tidyverse workflow. (Credit where it’s due: Emily Paul, a summer intern from Avon High School, helped extend the package functionality and has since used it in other projects and provided critical feedback on its design.) This week, i finally deployed a pkgdown website and tweeted a meek solicitation for feedback.</description>
