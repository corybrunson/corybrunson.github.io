## who i am (here)

I'm Cory Brunson<sup>he/him/his</sup>, and this is a lightweight space for me to practice expressing my outlook on matters at least peripherally professional. I completed a PhD in mathematics in 2013, and i'm now a postdoctoral fellow and trainee doing network analysis, data science, and health informatics. I'm an enthusiast for the extended [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) library, and i'm exploring new techniques and applications of [topological data analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04019).

Very soon i'll have a [`hugo-academic`](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) professional website (it's forcing me to finally upgrade from Mavericks). In the meantime, you can find me at the [Center for Quantitative Medicine](https://health.uconn.edu/quantitative-medicine/) or at the links in the footer.[^nofancy]

## what and how i blog

My schedule and content may evolve, but my goal at the outset is to post fortnightly or so on, or in the vicinity of, four categories: professional development, research progress, methodological technique, and personal curiosity. I want to use this space to express ideas that are messy and incomplete; i'll strive both to read others as charitably as reasonable and to write with the expectation that others will do the same.

I haven't incorporated comments, but feel free to send me feedback via email or social media!
